# Project-2---NBA-2016-Draft
#In this project I decided to use measureable data from college prospects who were entering the NBA Draft. I wanted to look through their data to learn
#about any trends that the league has been following, and seeing if there was a way to make a model of how NBA teams pick players. 
#In recent years the NBA has become incredibly reliant on players with great size and wingspan, so in my research that is what I focused on to see if I could have any informative takeaways
