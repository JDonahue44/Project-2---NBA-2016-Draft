# Project-2---NBA-2016-Draft
#In this project I decided to use measureable data from college prospects who were entering the NBA Draft. I wanted to look through their data to learn
#about any trends that the league has been following, and seeing if there was a way to make a model of how NBA teams pick players. 
#In recent years the NBA has become incredibly reliant on players with great size and wingspan, so in my research that is what I focused on to see if I could have any informative takeaways

Throughout my dataset I took the time to go through the nuances of information that was given to try and find any takeaways to be had.
I was able to learn about the main columns of information related to players wingspans which were : Height, Standing Reach & Vertical Max Reach.
These crucial columns gave me insight into how players were drafted based on how they measured in these key categories, but I wanted to focus on Wingspan.
In the NBA space is crucial vertically & horizontally and the ability to take up that space with your wingspan is important. 
In the data I was able to see that the 1st round of picks were clustered inside the wingspans of 80.0 & 87.5 inches with 1 outlier.
